# hello-world
Yet another n00b repo!

Hi people, my name is Tully Bascomb and this is my slice of github. I live somewhere in the SW of the UK. I've been using and experimenting with linux for several years, and recently ventured into BSDs.
I love all things FOSS, linux, bsd and so on. I'm a geek, an engineer and a scientist, and I love reading, tech, geeky things, brewing beer and drinking it.
